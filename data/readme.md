This file contains data from the social network survey conducted with students of PL4246 in AY2022/23, Sem 2. There are 77 rows and 77 columns in this dataset. The row and column names correspond to the student names. The value in each cell, if non-zero, denotes the presence of a connection between the two students. 1 indicates that the rating was asymmetric whereas 2 indicates that the rating was symmetric (i.e., both students "selected" the other in the survey). Information about the asymmetry of the ratings can be obtained from `ay2023s2_pl4246_data_v2.csv`. If the value is 0, there is no connection between the two students.
